# Time matters


This week we consider another important factor that is present in our data that we don't always talk about, and that is the importance of *time*. The importance of place in criminology and crime analysis is widely discussed. We know certain areas can be crime hotspots, and we know that whether you come from a well of or depreived area you have different access to resources, and therefore your outcomes in terms of involvement with criminal justica system also differs. However time is just as important as place. We often hear that crime is "going up" or "going down" over time. It is very important, that as well-rounded criminologists, you are able to talk about these concepts with appropriate knowledge and understanding. 

When violence increases bewteen March and August, is that because we are seeing an increase in crime and offending? Or is it possible that the time of year has something to do with this? How much must crime increase and over how long of a time, in order to be able to confidently say that crime is on the increase? These are important, and not always easy questions to answer, and this week we will begin to think about this. 


*** Another paragraoh about space and time here ***


## Crime and incident trend identification


All crimes occur at a specific date and time, however such definite temporal information is only available when victims or witnesses are present, alarms are triggered, etc., at the time of occurrence. This specific temporal data is most often collected in crimes against persons. In these cases, cross-tabulations or histogram of weekday and hour by count will suffice. The great majority of reported events are crimes against property. In these cases, there are seldom victims or witnesses present. These events present the analyst with ‘ranged’ temporal data, that is, an event reported as occurring over a range of hours or even days. In the case of ranged temporal data, analysis is possible through use of equal chance or probability methods. If an event was reported as having occurred from Monday to Tuesday, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is assumed the event had an equal chance or probability of occurring on each of the two days, or .5 (%50). In the same manner, if an event was reported as having occurred over a 10 hour span there is a 10% chance the event occurred during any one of the hours. This technique requires a reasonable number of events in the data set to be effective. The resulting probabilities are totalled in each category and graphed or cross-tabulated. This produces a comparison of relative frequency, by weekday or hour [source](http://cradpdf.drdc-rddc.gc.ca/PDFS/unc76/p530054.pdf).


**Temporal crime analysis** looks at trends in crime or incidents. A crime or incident trend is a broad direction or pattern that specific types or general crime and/or incidents are following.

Three types of trend can be identified:

- overall trend – highlights if the problem is getting worse, better or staying the same over a period of time
- seasonal, monthly, weekly or daily cycles of offences – identified by comparing previous time periods with the same period being analysed
- random fluctuations – caused by a large number of minor influences, or a one-off event, and can include displacement of crime from neighbouring areas due to partnership activity or crime initiatives.


### Lubridate: your guardian angel when it comes to working with temporal data

This week we will be looking at crime data from the USA. As you saw, the data from police.uk is aggregated by months. We do not know when the offences happened, only the month, but nothing more granular than that. American police data on the other hand is much more granular. 


Cities release their own data. Here, we will be looking at crimes from Dallas, Texas. [You can see more about these data, and find the download link to the data dictionary here](https://www.dallasopendata.com/Public-Safety/Police-Bulk-Data/ftja-9jxd). You can download a subset of Dallas crime data from blackboard. Go to course content > week 7 > Data for week 7, and the file is *dallas_burg.xlsx*. Download this and open it up in excel. 

***YOU PROBABLY WANT A CSV HERE***


When you read the data into R, you will see that there is a column for date called **Date.of.Occurrence**. The date is in the format dd/mm/yyyy. So the first date on there you can see is  16/11/2016. 


But what if I asked you the question: which year had the most residential burglaries? Or what if I want to know if residential burglaries happen more in the weekday, when people are at work, or in the weekends, maybe when people are away for a holiday? You have the date, so you should be able to answer these questions, right? 


Well you need to be able to have the right variables to answer these questions. To know what year saw the most residential burglaries, you need to have a variable for year. To know what day of the week has the most burglaries, you need to have a variable for day of the week. So how can we extract these variables from your date column? Well luckily the lubridate package can help us do this. 

***INSERT HERE TUROTIAL ON LUBRIDATE TO EXTRACT TIME***
Eg: for Making Sense I had them look at patterns in burgary for day of the week. Then we reach this conclusion: 

Now you can use this variable to create a pivot table, and see the number of burglaries on weekdays or weekends. Let's create this crosstab: 



Unsurprisingly, there are a lot more burglaries on weekdays than weekends. Why do you think that is? Take a moment to chat to the person next to you and discuss.

So what did you discuss? I am hoping that you mentioned that there were a lot more weekdays than weekend-days in our data, and in fact, in all weeks. There are 2.5 times as many weekdays than weekends in a week. I know, it's a sad truth, we work a lot more than we get to rest. But another thing that happens because of this, is that simply looking at the number of burglaries in weekdays and in weekdays might not be a very meaningful measure. Remember earlier, when we spoke about comparing like for like? Or last week, when we talked about the crime rate (per 100,000 population) versus the number of crimes? Well again here, we should calculate a rate; to truly be able to compare, we should look at a rate such as the number of burglaries *per day* for weekdays, and the number of burglaries *per day* for weekend-days. 


Remember discussing how do you calculate the rate? Well you do this simply by dividing the numerator (number of burglaries) by an appopriate denominator. What is the best denominator? Well it depends on the question you're looking to answer. Usually it's what comes after the *per*. If we are looking for number of crimes *per population* then we will be dividing by the population. If we are looking at number of burglaries *per household* we will be dividing by the number of households in an area. In this case, we were talking about the number of burglaries *per day* to compare between weekends and weekdays. So, your denominator will be the number of days for each group. 


So, to get the burglary rate (per day), we simply take our total number of burglaries from our pivot table, and divide by the number of days for each. As we know, there are 5 weekdays (boo) and 2 weekends (yaay). So let's divide accordingly: 





And copy also for the weekends, and voila we have our answer to the question, are there more burglaries on weekdays or weekends:






Now you can discuss again why you think this might be. For example, during the week, people are away from their homes for work, for the majority of each day, which leaves their home unprotected. I've mentioned the [crime triangle](https://popcenter.asu.edu/content/problem-analysis-triangle-0) before. If the resident is not home, then there is an absence of a capable guardian, and there is an increased risk for a crime (such as burglary) to occur! 



There are many things that peak on certain days of the week. If you're interested in some more examples, [read this article in the Guardian about the most dangerous days of the week](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/29/most-dangerous-day-of-week). 



## Aggregating to simple intervals

Above the activities have you the ability to extract certain types of date categories from the date column. If we want to compare year on year increase or decrease, this is one approach. Or if we want to compare day of week, month of year, and so on. We did this by creating a new variable, and then using a pivot table. We could also look at the date as it is, we could have a look at the number of crimes each day, but often this can be noisy. Instead, sometimes we want to aggregate (group) these into simpler time intervals.

First, we've not had a look at our time variable yet, so we could start with that. 


### Aggregating burglary to hour


First create a new column for 'Hour':

## Visualising time on a map


Here I had stuff about cyclical variable so line graph vs radar grapgh, but I assume here we want to be spatial about time, so let's get some spacial examples in here. 



## Time series

A Time Series is an ordered sequence of values of a variable at equally spaced time intervals.
Time series occur frequently when looking at industrial data. The usage of time series models is threefold:

- To help reveal or clarify trends by obtaining an understanding of the underlying forces and structure that produced the observed data
- To forecast future patterns of events by fitting a model
– To test the impact of interventions 


Time Series Analysis is an analytic technique that uses a sequence of data points, measured typically at successive, uniform time intervals, to identify trends and other characteristics of the data. For example, a time series analysis may be used to study a city’s crime rate over time and predict future crime trends.



All time-series data have three basic parts:

- A trend component;
- A seasonal component; and
- A random component.


Trends are often masked because of the combination of these three components – especially the random noise!


Two types of patterns are important:
- Linear or non-linear trends - i.e., upwards or downwards or both (quadratic); and
- Seasonal effects which follow the same overall trend but repeat themselves in systematic intervals over time. 


Smoothing data removes random variation and shows trends and cyclic components. Inherent in the collection of data taken over time is some form of random variation. There exist methods for reducing of canceling the effect due to random variation. An often-used technique in industry is "smoothing". This technique, when properly applied, reveals more clearly the underlying trend, seasonal and cyclic components.


In this course we will stick to the first option, and in particular we will look into producing *moving averages*. You should also know about the existence of *smoothing techniques*, and the sophisticated method for revealing trends is known as *seasonal decomposition*, however we will not be performing these ourselves today. 





### Moving averages


A moving average is a technique to get an overall idea of the trends in a data set; it is an average of any subset of numbers. The moving average is extremely useful for forecasting long-term trends. You can calculate it for any period of time. For example, if you have sales data for a twenty-year period, you can calculate a five-year moving average, a four-year moving average, a three-year moving average and so on. Stock market analysts will often use a 50 or 200 day moving average to help them see trends in the stock market and (hopefully) forecast where the stocks are headed.



An average represents the “middling” value of a set of numbers. The moving average is exactly the same, but the average is calculated several times for several subsets of data. For example, if you want a two-year moving average for a data set from 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 you would find averages for the subsets 2000/2001, 2001/2002 and 2002/2003. Moving averages are usually plotted and are best visualized.


Among the most popular technical indicators, moving averages are used to gauge the direction of the current trend. Every type of moving average (commonly written in this tutorial as MA) is a mathematical result that is calculated by averaging a number of past data points. Once determined, the resulting average is then plotted onto a chart in order to allow traders to look at smoothed data rather than focusing on the day-to-day price fluctuations that are inherent in all financial markets. 


The simplest form of a moving average, appropriately known as a simple moving average (SMA), is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of a given set of values. For example, to calculate a basic 10-day moving average you would add up the closing prices from the past 10 days and then divide the result by 10. In Figure 1, the sum of the prices for the past 10 days (110) is divided by the number of days (10) to arrive at the 10-day average. If a trader wishes to see a 50-day average instead, the same type of calculation would be made, but it would include the prices over the past 50 days. The resulting average below (11) takes into account the past 10 data points in order to give traders an idea of how an asset is priced relative to the past 10 days. 



Perhaps you're wondering why technical traders call this tool a "moving" average and not just a regular mean? The answer is that as new values become available, the oldest data points must be dropped from the set and new data points must come in to replace them. Thus, the data set is constantly "moving" to account for new data as it becomes available. This method of calculation ensures that only the current information is being accounted for. In Figure 2, once the new value of 5 is added to the set, the red box (representing the past 10 data points) moves to the right and the last value of 15 is dropped from the calculation. Because the relatively small value of 5 replaces the high value of 15, you would expect to see the average of the data set decrease, which it does, in this case from 11 to 10.
